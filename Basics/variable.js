/*
NOTE:

like if you declare a variable with var inside a function, it can be accessed outside that function, while let is block-scoped.
mostly we use let and const in modern JavaScript, because var can lead to confusion due to its scope.
scope means where the variable can be accessed in the code.

accountCity = "satara"; // in js we can declare a variable without using let, const, or var, but it's not recommended as it creates a global variable.
